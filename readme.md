## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To integrate Contentful into your .NET application, you need to configure your API keys and other settings. Add the following section to your `appsettings.json` file:

```json
"ContentfulOptions": {
  "DeliveryApiKey": "<Your Delivery API Key>",
  "ManagementApiKey": "<Your Management API Key>",
  "PreviewApiKey": "<Your Preview API Key>",
  "SpaceId": "<Your Space ID>",
  "UsePreviewApi": false,
  "MaxNumberOfRateLimitRetries": 0
}
```

Explanation of Configuration Options:

- DeliveryApiKey: API key for accessing published content via the Content Delivery API (CDA).
- ManagementApiKey: API key for managing content via the Content Management API (CMA).
- PreviewApiKey: API key for accessing draft content via the Content Preview API (CPA).
- SpaceId: The unique identifier for your Contentful space.
- UsePreviewApi: Set to true if you want to fetch draft content using the Preview API.
- MaxNumberOfRateLimitRetries: The number of retries the SDK should attempt when encountering rate limits.
